## Installation

If you haven't already, please follow the [installation instructions](installation). Once BabyBench is successfully installed, you can start by trying out the examples presented below.

## Examples

We provide some basic examples with starter code to help you get up and running with training MIMo using reinforcement learning. These examples are available in the ``examples`` folder of the [starter kit](https://github.com/babybench/babybench2025_starter_kit).

If you are looking for inspiration on how to model the development of the specific behaviors, we recommend having a look at the references mentioned in the [about page](about).
