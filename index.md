# BabyBench 2025 Competition

BabyBench is a multimodal benchmark of infant behaviors for developmental artificial intelligence. The objective is to teach typical developmental behaviors to [MIMo](https://github.com/trieschlab/MIMo), a multimodal infant model. We provide the embodiment, the simulation environments, and the evaluation metrics; all you need is to implement your ideas.

The first **BabyBench Competition** will take place at the [***IEEE* ICDL 2025 Conference**](https://icdl2025.fel.cvut.cz/) in Prague! The topic of this first edition will be *how infants discover their own bodies*. Can you help MIMo learn two typical infant behaviors: [**self touch**](../about/#self-touch) and [**hand regard**](../about/#hand-regard)?
