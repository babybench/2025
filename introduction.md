## Motivation

How do infants develop a sense of self?

The early stages of human development are characterized by rich sensorimotor exploration where infants engage in self-touch, self-reach and spontanoous movements that contribute to body awareness and motor control (Rochat, *Exp. Brain Res.* 1998). These behaviors are observed within the first months of life and are fundamental for the emergence of the calibration of proprioception and motor coordination. While infant development has been extensively studied in psychology and neuroscience, replicating these behaviors on a humanoid robotic platform remains a major challenge.

This challenge invites participants to design and implement mechanisms that enable MIMo, a baby-sized humanoid agent equipped with a tactile skin and binocular vision, to autonomously generate self-touching and hand regard behaviors similar to those seen in human infants. The objective here is to model developmental principles such as learning how to explore, building and exploiting sensorimotor loops and intrinsic motivation that drives actions in human infants (Oudeyer & Smith, *Top. Cog. Sci.* 2016).

Participants will work within custom-designed MIMo environments, specifically tailored to support the study of early infant-like behaviors, such as self-touch and hand regard, by providing a realistic, physics-based humanoid model. Successful solutions should demonstrate emergent behaviors where the agent discovers, through self-exploration, affordances of movements and refines motor skills without explicitly programmed trajectories.
